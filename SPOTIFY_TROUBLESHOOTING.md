# Spotify Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
Your app is stuck on "Connecting to Spotify..." with annotation resolution warnings.

## Most Likely Causes & Solutions

### 1. ✅ **Spotify Developer Dashboard Setup** (MUST DO FIRST)
**Problem**: App not registered properly or missing fingerprint
**Solution**: 
1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create/find your app with Client ID: `0897452c456b4f468a7d1ca8bc42f535`
3. Add Android package:
   - **Package Name**: `com.kevdadev.musicminds`
   - **SHA-1 Fingerprint**: `A3:1B:35:83:96:FC:7D:E4:ED:9C:81:9B:E1:27:BE:03:64:DD:66:28`
4. Set **Redirect URI**: `musicminds://callback`

### 2. ✅ **ProGuard Rules** (FIXED)
**Problem**: Spotify SDK classes being obfuscated
**Status**: Added comprehensive ProGuard rules

### 3. **Spotify App Requirements**
**Check these on your device**:
- ✅ Spotify app is installed
- ✅ You're logged into Spotify
- ❓ Spotify app is up to date (update from Play Store)
- ❓ Spotify has necessary permissions enabled

### 4. **Testing Steps**
After fixing dashboard setup, try these:

1. **Clean and rebuild**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean assembleDebug
   ```

2. **Clear app data** and reinstall

3. **Check device logs** for specific error messages

## Common Error Messages

| Error Type | Meaning | Solution |
|------------|---------|----------|
| `UserNotAuthorizedException` | App not authorized | Check dashboard setup |
| `SpotifyDisconnectedException` | Spotify not running/logged in | Open Spotify app first |
| `CouldNotFindSpotifyApp` | Spotify not installed | Install Spotify |
| `AuthenticationFailedException` | Wrong client ID/fingerprint | Verify dashboard config |

## Quick Test
After dashboard setup, run the app and check logcat for detailed error messages. The enhanced logging will show exactly what's failing.

## Next Steps
1. **FIRST**: Complete Spotify Developer Dashboard setup
2. Clean build and test
3. Check logs for specific error type
4. Report back with exact error message
