# US02: Song Search and Addition

## User Story
**As a** user, **I want** to search for songs on Spotify and add them to my learning queue, **so that** I can build my personalized song library for flashcards.

## Context
- Users need a way to populate their song library before they can start learning
- Individual song search provides a precise way to add specific songs
- This feature establishes the initial content needed for the flashcard functionality

## Acceptance Criteria (Given–When–Then)
- **Given** I am authenticated with Spotify, **when** I navigate to "Add Songs", **then** I should see a search interface.
- **Given** I am on the search interface, **when** I enter a search term, **then** I should see relevant song results from Spotify.
- **Given** I am viewing search results, **when** I select a song, **then** I should see details including title, artist, and release year.
- **Given** I am viewing a song's details, **when** I select "Add to Library", **then** the song should be added to my "To Learn" category.
- **Given** I am viewing search results, **when** I tap the "+" button next to a song, **then** it should be added directly to my "To Learn" category without viewing details.
- **Given** I try to add a song that's already in my library, **when** I select "Add to Library", **then** I should be notified that the song already exists.
- **Given** I have a spotty internet connection, **when** I perform a search, **then** appropriate error handling should occur with user feedback.

- Song model should include: spotifyId, title, artist, album, releaseYear, previewUrl, imageUrl
