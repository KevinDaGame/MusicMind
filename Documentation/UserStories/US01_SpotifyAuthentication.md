# US01: Spotify Authentication

## User Story
**As a** user, **I want** to connect my Spotify account to MusicMinds, **so that** I can access and play songs for my flashcard sessions.

## Context
- Spotify integration is the foundation of the app's functionality
- Required for accessing Spotify's song library and playback functionality
- Essential first step before any other features can be implemented

## Acceptance Criteria (Given–When–Then)
- **Given** I have installed the MusicMinds app, **when** I open it for the first time, **then** I should be prompted to authenticate with Spotify.
- **Given** I am on the authentication screen, **when** I select "Connect to Spotify", **then** I should be directed to the Spotify login page.
- **Given** I have entered valid Spotify credentials, **when** I authorize the MusicMinds app, **then** I should be redirected back to the app as an authenticated user.
- **Given** I am an authenticated user, **when** I use the app, **then** my authentication status should persist between sessions.
- **Given** my authentication token has expired, **when** I open the app, **then** it should automatically refresh my credentials if possible.
- **Given** I want to disconnect my account, **when** I select "Disconnect from Spotify" in settings, **then** my authentication should be revoked.

## Technical Details
- Implement Spotify's Authorization SDK for Android
- Request scopes needed: user-read-private, user-read-email, streaming
- Store authentication tokens securely using Android's KeyStore system
- Implement token refresh mechanism to handle expirations
- Handle authentication errors and edge cases (no internet, invalid credentials)
